#This wiki page will take you through on how to use JAXL Client library

= Introduction =

JAXL Client Library is highly structured. There is a base XMPP class library and a JAXL class library which is derived from the base XMPP class library.

Base XMPP class library implements the XMPP protocol and also provides you with two extendable methods named eventMessage() and eventPresence(). These methods are internally called when a message or presence XML Stanza is received from the Jabber server.

You should have a look at included *jaxl.class.php* and modify extended eventMessage() and eventPresence() methods as required.
