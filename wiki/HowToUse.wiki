This wiki page will take you through on how to use JAXL Client library

= Introduction =

JAXL Client Library is highly structured. There is a base XMPP class library *(xmpp.class.php)* and a JAXL class library *(jaxl.class.php)* which is derived from the base XMPP class library.

Base XMPP class library implements the XMPP protocol and also provides you with two extendable methods named *eventMessage()* and *eventPresence()*. These methods are internally called when a message or presence XML Stanza is received from the Jabber server.

You should have a look at included *jaxl.class.php* and modify extended eventMessage() and eventPresence() methods as required.


== Example JAXL Class ==
{{{
  /* Include XMPP Class */
  include_once("xmpp.class.php");
  
  class JAXL extends XMPP {
    
    function eventMessage($fromJid, $content, $offline = FALSE) {
      // Take necessary action when a message is received 
      $this->sendMessage($fromJid,"Hi, Thanks for your message");
    }
    
    function eventPresence($fromJid, $status, $photo) {
      // Take necessary action when a presence is received
    }
    
  }
}}}
